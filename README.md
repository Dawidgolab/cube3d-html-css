# 3D Rotating Cube with CSS
## This is a simple HTML and CSS project that creates a 3D rotating cube.

## Overview
### This project is a demonstration of a 3D cube created using HTML and CSS. The cube rotates in both the X and Y axes to give a 3D effect. Each face of the cube is a different color, making it visually appealing. It's a basic example of CSS 3D transformations and animations.

## How It Works
- The project is a single HTML file that contains the cube and its animations.
- The cube is created using HTML div elements, with each face of the cube represented as a separate div with a different background color.
- CSS is used to style and position the cube and its faces. The key CSS properties that make this project work are transform, perspective, and @keyframes animations.
- The cube is animated using the @keyframes animation called obracaniekostki, which rotates the cube in the Y and X axes. The animation is set to be infinite and alternate, so it keeps rotating back and forth.
- The margin and position properties are used to position and center the cube on the screen.
## How to Use
- Clone or download this repository.
- Open the index.html file in a modern web browser.
- You will see a 3D rotating cube with different colored faces.
- You can modify the colors or other styles in the CSS to customize the appearance of the cube.
